# San Francisco Crime Classification
Machine learning to predict San Francisco crimes

This notebook performs exploratory analysis data visualisation with python to see what the data tells about the crimes in San Francisco.

The dataset was taken from [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime) which happens to be collected by [SF Police Department](https://datasf.org/opendata/) reporting system. Then the code applies a machine learning algorithm in order to guess the category of the crimes using Naive Bayes algorithm as it's one of the simplest classification algorithms.
